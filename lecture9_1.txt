example 1:

a = 1;
f(a);
print a;


function f(x) {
  x = x+1;
  x = x+a;
  print x;
}


call by value

call by value return

example 2:
int a[] = new {1,2,3,4};
f(a);
print a;

f(x) {
	x = new {5,6,7,8};
	print x;
}

pass by value
5,6,7,8
1,2,3,4

pass by reference
5,6,7,8
5,6,7,8



example 3:

int a[] = new {1,2,3,4};
f(a);
print a;

f(x) {
	x[1] = 7;
	print x;
}

pass by value of the address. x is the same address as a. x[1] == a[1]
1,7,3,4
1,7,3,4
